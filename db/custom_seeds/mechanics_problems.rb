 The distances between the disc and the horizontal planes
of the cavity are both equal to $h = 1.0 mm$. Find the power developed by
the viscous force acting on the disc while it rotates with angular
velocity equal to $\omega = 60 rad/s$. Neglect the end effects!!! ",

co-axial cylinders of radii $R_1=10 cm$, and $R_2=12 cm$. The small cylinder
doesnt rotates while the outer one is rotated with a constant
angular velocity $\omega=20 rad/s$. The flow of the fluid is laminar. The
 friction force acting on a unit area of a cylindrical surface
of radius $r$ is defined by the formula: $$\sigma= \eta r (\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial r})$$
Find he moment of the friction force acting on the outer cylinder if the length of both cylinders 
is $1 m$. Neglect the end effects!!! ",
